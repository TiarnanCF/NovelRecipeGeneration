A summary of what each folder contains.

./Data contains the data from CulinaryDB which was used to construct the original network.

./WSBM_v1.3 contains the code provided for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model.

./adjMx contained the adjacency matrices for the constructed layers of the network.

./params_global contans the final parameters proposed by the WSBM

./params contains a subset of those parameters for only certain layers of the network which I focused on in this project.
